## The Basics

### What's included
fibre uses the popular Javascript-based streaming build system [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to automate your workflow. Common tasks are included to handle all the basics needs of web project development.

### HTML
Included is a base HTML template that utlizes best practices for mobile rendering, SEO, and performance. It also includes a placeholder 404 template.

### BrowserSync
fibre leverages [BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/) providing you with an easy way to run your project locally. Upon first running fibre, a new browser window will be launched that will reload with your latest changes whenever you update the code base.

### SCSS & Compass
CSS in fibre is written using SCSS and Compass. fibre automatically compiles into minified CSS complete with source map support. Using AutoPrefixer and Modernizr, fibre makes sure you have all your supported browsers covered.

### Grid System
Also included is fibreGrid, a customizable, responsive, mobile-first CSS grid system to further help you get straight to coding. Configure the number of columns, margins, and breakpoints to make fibreGrid work for any project. As of 1.1.0 fibre now supports [basic `flexbox` functionality](docs/grid.md#flexbox).

### JavaScript
fibre provides an easy way to write clean, modularized JavaScript using [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). All JS is automatically compiled and minified complete with source map support.
