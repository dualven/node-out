# Miscellaneous Functionality in fibre

## Cache-busting
Your references to `main.css` are automatically cache-busted up build by [revising the file name for maximum compatibility](http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2008/08/23/revving-filenames-dont-use-querystring/). This is accounted for in the included `.htaccess` and the BrowserSync config.

## Image Optimization
All `.jpg` and `.png`  in the `img` folder are automatically optimized on build.

## EditorConfig
fibre includes a file for use with [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org/) to allow you to sync your format settings across your team.
