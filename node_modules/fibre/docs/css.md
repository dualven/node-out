# CSS & SASS in fibre
By default fibre pre-processes CSS using [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

## Structure
fibre's structure closely follows [SMACSS Categorization](https://smacss.com/book/categorizing).

## Autoprefixer
fibre uses [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) to automatically add all necessary CSS vendor prefixes at build time. The default browserlist `> 1%', 'last 2 versions', 'Firefox ESR', 'Opera 12.1` can be chaged in `config.json`.

### `main.scss`
All `.scss` files are imported into `main.scss` and compiled into a single CSS file `main.css` on build.

### Compass
fibre includes Compass to provide you a variety of reusable patterns. By default fibre imports Compass's [Reset Module](http://compass-style.org/reference/compass/reset/)

###`Components`
The folder contains items that fall under the [Base](https://smacss.com/book/type-base) and [Layout](https://smacss.com/book/type-layout) classifications of SMACSS as well as basic configuration files such as global SASS variables. All files in this folder should begin with `_` to denote that they are imported and not referenced directly.

#### `_variables.scss`
This file acts as a configuration file for your SCSS files. All global variables are declared here, for example:

* Base font-sizes
* Base file paths
* Colors

#### `_mixins.scss` & `_placeholders.scss`
These two files contain your global [Mixins](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#mixins) and [Placeholders](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#placeholder_selectors_). 

Mixins should only be used when you need your CSS output to change based on one or more variables. Otherwise, Placeholders should be used in order to keep your code DRY as Placeholders do not duplicate themselves whenever you use them.

Both files contain necessary dependencies for [fibreGrid](grid.md).

#### `_layout.scss`
This file contains the core layout code for [fibreGrid](grid.md). More information on configuration and usage is available in the [fibreGrid Documenation](grid.md).

### `Modules`
This folder is for page/section styling. SMACSS goes into [more detail](https://smacss.com/book/type-module) as to what qualifies as a Module.

## Source Maps
fibre includes support for browers that support Source Maps for pre-processed CSS. You can read more about how to enable this functionality in [Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/css-preprocessors) and [Firefox](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/02/live-editing-sass-and-less-in-the-firefox-developer-tools/). Safari supports source maps for SCSS out of the box.
