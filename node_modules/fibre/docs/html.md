# HTML in fibre
By default fibre provides two HTML templates

* `index.html` - The base html page for use as the base for all your website or application pages.
* `404.html` - A placeholder 404 page.

## Build Process
All HTML files are moved form `src` to `dist` when Gulp detects a change. The reference to main.css in all html files is [cache-busted](#css-cache-busting) automatically.

## `index.html`

### Detect JavaScript
`index.html` leverages a `no-js` class to enable specific functionality for when JavaScript is not available. fibre includes the requisite JS to flip on the `js` flag as well.

### Meta Tags
`<meta charset="UTF-8">`

The `charset` meta tag must be:

* Declared within the [first 1024 bytes of the document](https://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/semantics.html#charsethttps://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7).
* Should be specified before any other content to avoid [a potential security issue](https://code.google.com/p/doctype-mirror/wiki/ArticleUtf7) with Internet Explorer.

### X-UA-Compatible
`<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">`

The `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag must be:

* Declared before anything except the `<title>` and other `<meta>` tags.
* Declared to avoid issues with [document compatibility mode](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc288325.aspx) in IE 8/9/10.

### Mobile Viewport
`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`

fibre sets the mobile viewport to an initial zoom-level of one and *does not* disable zoom. It is not advised that you disable zoom for accessibility reason. Apple provides [further documenation](https://developer.apple.com/library/safari/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/UsingtheViewport/UsingtheViewport.html) about the use of this meta tag.

### Favicons & Apple Touch Icons 
fibre provides placeholder icons for browsers and Apple touch devices in the root of the built project.

### CSS Cache-busting
fibre automatically cache-busts your main.css reference on build. This ensures you are always serving the latest version of your CSS file regardless of your visitor's cache settings.

### Modernizr
[Modernizr](http://modernizr.com/docs/) is included in order to leverage its [vast feature detection capabilities](http://modernizr.com/docs/). It is loaded before the rest of the document, as it needs to run before the browser has rendered the page to provide full functionality. Modernizr's classes can be used to specific styling and functionality based on the browser's support for specific features. 

### Google Universal Analytics
fibre includes an [optimized, ansynchronous version of the Google Analytics snippet](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/async-analytics-snippet#universal-analytics). It is placed at the bottom of the page for performance purposes. 

*Note:* Google does recommend that this snippet is placed at the top of the page to ensure that you are tracking all users, even if they don't load the entire page.
